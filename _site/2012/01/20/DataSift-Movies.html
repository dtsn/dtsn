		<p>Do you remember <a href='http://fflick.com'>fflick</a>? Probably not, it was a start up brought by google for a $10 million price tag a couple of years going. What fflick did was to basically gather users movie reviews across social movies. For this hackathon we decided to do the same, but using the power of DataSift we are able to gather information and give them a score.</p>

<p>We managed to produce a movie review site that crowd source all it&#8217;s reviews and gave each movie a score based upon user sentiment to films and the split between male and female.</p>

<p>Unfortunately DataSift Movies was never made available to the public.</p>
