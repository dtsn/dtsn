I was drawn to Le Creusets range of cooking pans firstly by their lifetime gaurentee, i love the idea of only ever buying something once and it lasting forever. However as i research more into them i discovered more features that made me fall in love with them!

First we need to get over the price, averaging around ~Â£100 per pan these are not the cheapest, or best value pans on the market. However i do think they are one of the best.

Avoid the non stick
