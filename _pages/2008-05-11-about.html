This site is developed and maintained by me, Daniel Saxil-Nielsen. I am a professional web developer working in Reading, UK. I have been working professionally since 2007.
<h2>The Site</h2>
The site takes it's name from my initials and is a place I can post articles, tutorials and the design inspiration which not only I find interesting but will also be interesting to other web designers and professionals.
