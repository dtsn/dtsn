**Using Lego Mindstorms to bring a cake to life**

I was recently asked to bring a cake shaped like a tank to life for my newphew. Luckily I had an old version of the [Lego NXT](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BMKLVJ6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00BMKLVJ6&linkCode=as2&tag=dtsn-21) which I wasn't using. The Lego NXT system is pretty awesome, it comes with a basic set of servos and sensors and you can then use a very simple drag and drop interface to program it.

## The program
I initially worked by programming the Lego, below is the program which I used complete with sound effects. It uses a very simple of program, there is one motor which spins a bit to the left, a bit to the right and then plays a sound. The program looks like the following:

This simple behviour looks like this:

## The cake board
We need to construct a special cake board so we were able to switch the cake on and off. This envolved cutting a hole out of a piece of MDF so we could see the screen and activate the buttons.

## Building the cake
The cake is made from a simple sponge which is in 3 layers. Each layer has a hole in the middle to fit the Lego, which was encased in a box. The turrent is constructed out of rice crispys and marshmallows with the Lego cast into them. Then it's a simple case of mouting the turret on the top and decorate.

Unfortuantely under the 3 layers of cake you can no longer hear the tank sound.
