I’ve been digging through the <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a> code a lot recently and have stumbled upon a number of very effective transitions which aren’t used widely. There are 9 effects in total comprising of:

Transition
<ul>
	<li>Transition</li>
	<li>Linear</li>
	<li>Reverse</li>
	<li>Flicker</li>
	<li>Wobble</li>
	<li>Pulse</li>
	<li>Spring</li>
	<li>None</li>
	<li>Full</li>
</ul>
You can see a full demo of all the the effects on the <a href="http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/wikis/effect-transitions">Script.aculo.us Wiki</a>.

Trouble Implementing?

All of Script.aculo.us’s effects will take a transition in the options array. For example we could apply a spring transition to our scroll to effect.
