Link prefetching is a very little known HTML 5 tag which is currently only supported by Firefox. It utilizes browser idle time to download documents that the user might visit in the near future.

For example:

<pre class="html">&lt;link rel=&quot;prefetch&quot; href=&quot;page2.html&quot;&gt;
</pre>

Once the user has loaded up that page the next page (page2.html) will being loading significantly decreasing the time it takes to visit the next page. 

It's a great idea really, and because it's gracefully degregating it means that users in FF will get the benefit while everyone else wouldn't see the difference. Refer to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/link_prefetching_faq">Mozilla FAQ</a> for more information.
