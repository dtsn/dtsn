<p>At the end of September I was invited to a shoot for the UK edition of Wired. It was a shoot based around the twitterati of the UK and included some big names like Iain Dodsworth. The shoot was based at the old BT museum, which became defunct when their archive went online. You can see me and the other 24 people in Wiredâ€™s December Issue, on sale from today.</p>
