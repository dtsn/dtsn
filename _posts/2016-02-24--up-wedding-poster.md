Myself and Jade love UP and we are incorporating tiny bits of it into our wedding. One of the awesome ideas we've seen on pinterest is to have an up poster whereby people can use their finger prints to create the balloons. Its a fantastic idea so I created up a custom poster. We're getting it printed onto some lovely 300gsm matt paper by our local printer. I'll share a picture when we get the final result.

It's designed to perfectly fit an Ikea 40x50 glass frame ðŸ˜Š.
