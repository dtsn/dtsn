Anatoly Zenkov (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anatoliy_zenkov/">flickr</a>) has created a great little Java app which will record your mouse pointer movements over your screen and then save the image of all your mouse movements. You get some great screenshots (have a look at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anatoliy_zenkov/4271592658/">some of the comments</a> on the flickr post).

You can download the little Java App from here <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/684632/mousepath.exe.zip">PC</a>, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/684632/mousepath.jar">Mac</a>

Here are some of my screenshots below. The best thing about this app is that it makes a great tool for UI testing. You can see where a user clicks and their mouse paths really easily!
