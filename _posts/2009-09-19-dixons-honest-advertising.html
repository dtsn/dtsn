<p>I have just seen this posters from Dixons, the electronics retailer, over at <a href="http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2009/september/dixons">Creative Review</a> and i was shocked to see how honest this advertising campaign is, it clearly reflects how Dixons sees itself in the market place. </p>  <p><a href="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-uploads/2009/09/image1.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-uploads/2009/09/image-thumb.png" width="235" height="352" /></a> <a href="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-uploads/2009/09/image2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-uploads/2009/09/image-thumb1.png" width="235" height="352" /></a> </p>  <p>These posters created by M&amp;C Saatchi in London are Dixons latest effort in advertising on the tube. These adverts do something that most adverts overlook, the recognise Dixons position in the market and how their customers both behave and view them, firmly at the bottom. The cleverest bit of these adverts in to use the easily recognisable fonts of the two major retailers, Selfridges and John Lewis. These, however are really subtle, and without realising this the adverts become really bland. Therefore do they really appeal to everyone, or are they just a bit too complicated, it probably would of been more effective to actually mention these retailers by name. </p>  <p>This problem would become even more apparent if the adverts where only displayed singly, then you wouldn’t get the contrast, and even through the brands which the fonts come from are strong, i don’t think typically consumers easily recognise the font of a brand out of context with their logo.</p>  <p>What do you think?</p>
