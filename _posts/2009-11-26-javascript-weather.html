<p>Here’s a crazy idea, what would you do if you wanted to change the background picture of your website so it matches the weather. Luckily Its really easy, and I figured out all the hard bits for you.</p>  <p><em>UPDATE - Chris Heilmann over at the </em><a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2009/12/extending_the_weather_api_with_yql.html"><em>Yahoo! Developer Network Blog</em></a><em> has made this even simpler through the use of YQL.</em></p>  <h3><span>The Data</span></h3>  <p>First of all we need a data source which will provide the weather for a particular location, we can grab this from the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/">Yahoo Weather API</a>. Using the code UKXX0117 which is for Reading, UK I can create the an RSS feed which you can see here <a title="http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0117&amp;u=c" href="http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0117&amp;u=c">http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0117&amp;u=c</a>. Great but how can we process this RSS feed? That’s where <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> comes in, we can take in the RSS feed extract the data we need (item.yweather.condition) and export it as JSON.</p> <p>Now we can access the JSON data for the weather in Reading <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=b13966505cb6b00dd1d18ec4aafc14b4&amp;_render=json">here</a>.</p>  <h3><span>JavaScript</span></h3>  <p>The JavaScript cannot directly call the JSON script via AJAX due to cross site scripting limitations imposed by the browser. This is where JSONP comes in, JSONP is a way to retrieve data from external domains through wrapping the JSON in a function, you can read more on JSONP at <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">from__future__import</a>. Yahoo Pipes fully supports the JSONP format using the parameter callback, therefore in our webpage we load up the following.</p>

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=b13966505cb6b00dd1d18ec4aafc14b4&_render=json&_callback=weather"></script>
{% endhighlight %}


<p>This will call the function weather passing through a weather status code as the parameter.</p>

<p>That is really it, you can do whatever you want with the data, here’s a quick example of how I would use it.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
function weather(data) { 
        var code = data.value.items[0].content;
	switch(code) {
		case '32': $(document.body).addClassName('sunny');
		break;	
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
