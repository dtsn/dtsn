<p>Over the last couple of days we have been working hard at <a href="http://fav.or.it">fav.or.it</a> on a new design for <a href="http://tweetmeme.com">tweetmeme</a>. The old design wasn’t very nice and lots of users were put off the site because of it’s garish colour scheme, but now we are back with, hopefully, a really successful new design.</p>  <p><strong>You can find a full review of the new features on the </strong><a href="http://blog.tweetmeme.com/2009/02/11/major-revamp/"><strong>tweetmeme blog</strong></a>.</p> <!--more-->  <div align="center">   <p><a href="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/holding.gif"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="holding" border="0" alt="holding" src="http://dtsn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/holding-thumb.gif" width="363" height="236" /></a> </p> </div>  <h4>Minimal</h4>  <p>Much like this website, Nick wanted the tweetmeme website to be really minimal and as far away from the old design as possible. A quick search on Kuler found the <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/193782">perfect colour scheme</a>. Combine that colour scheme with a few shades of grey and we have the perfect website.</p>  <h4>Rockwell</h4>  <p>You will notice that <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=201908">Rockwel</a>l is used a lot around the website, i thought that the bold text contrasted really nicely with the small and minimal design.</p>  <h4>Feedback</h4>  <p>I am always interested in any feedback any can give me about my designs, so please leave feedback here, or on the tweetmeme blog.</p>
