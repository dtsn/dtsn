<a href="http://twestival.com">Twestival</a> is just around the corner (Feb. 12th) and I thought I would share the special T-shirt that I designed for the occasion. I wanted a T-shirt which I could put my own username on, but I was unable to find one, therefore I broke out illustrator and started designing.

<!--more-->

I really wanted something that wasn’t in your face and was subtle, and preferably something that didn’t have the twitter logo on it. Therefore I chose a simple design using the original twitter bird, designed by Simon Oxley, available on <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/concepts-and-ideas/time/2437874-blue-bird.php?id=2437874">iStockPhoto</a>, and a cloud to hold the name.

There were some modifications that had to be made to the vector images, firstly none of the lines could be two small and all the objects had to be converted so that none of their paths crossed.

<h4>Using SpreadShirt</h4>
<a href="http://spreadshirt.net">SpreadShirt</a> was chosen to print the T-Shirts because they accept vector drawings which allow for the most flexibility when it comes to colours, they allow up the 3 colours, but I would only be using two. The uploading process is really old tech, each vector drawing has to be approved by a human before they let you use it, but this process should takes less than 24 hours.

After the design has been approved the design can then be added to products, anything from T-shirts to umbrella’s can be printed with your design. I choose 2 different forms of T-shirt one a slim fit and one a normal fit, £14.50 and £14 respectively. You can then tweak around with the designs/colours/text to get your design perfect. I also converted mine into a product for my own store.

You can currently buy this T-shirt which will be printed with your name, in one of 7 colours at <a href="http://dtsn.spreadshirt.net">http://dtsn.spreadshirt.co.uk.</a>

<strong>N.B. The Slim-Fit Tee is really slim fit, leave a comment if you would like the design on any other products like girl tee's, mugs, umbrella's etc.</strong>

<em>All the profits for this T-shirt will go to </em><a href="http://twestival.com"><em>Twestival</em></a><em>.</em>

<em>Roughly £1.40 - VAT will go to Twestival for every T-shirt brought, however spreadshirt will only release the money if more than 30 shirts are sold (thats just their store policy).</em>
