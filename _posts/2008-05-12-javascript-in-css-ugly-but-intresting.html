There is a very little used and unknown method which allows you to utilise JavaScript within a CSS file. The CSS Expression property allows you to assign a JavaScript expression to a CSS property. For example, this allows you to set the position of an element according to the browser size.

[code="css"]
width:expression(document.body.clientWidth > 950 ? "950px": "100%" );
[/code]

<strong>Do not use CSS Expression, they are unreliable, slow and are only supported in IE!</strong>

CSS Expression suddenly came to me as a solution for the currently much debated feature (<a href="http://www.dave-woods.co.uk/index.php/css-variables/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.css3.info/new-features-proposed-for-css/">here</a>) of <a href="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/cssvariables/">variables</a> in CSS3. This could theoretically be currently achieved through the use of CSS Expressions.

[code="css"]
function blue() {
return 'blue';
}

body { background: expression(blue()); }
[/code]

CSS Expressions are horrible and unsupported, so please don't use them in development. They do, however, highlight a interesting and little known feature of CSS.
